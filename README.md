#### Introduction
Our team is creating an application for TAMU Wakeboarding. The goal of this application is to automate the everyday tasks of the leadership team and the members. This application will keep track of all the members and their roles within the organization. It will give selective access to specific parts of the application based on the role of the member. This application serves four main users - admin, treasurer, drivers, and riders. The riders (every member of the organization) are only allowed to sign up for sets. The drivers, in addition to rider privileges, are allowed to create sets and submit receipts to the treasurer. They are also able to view all their receipts whether they have been processed, are being processed, or still need to be processed. The treasurer in addition to having rider privileges is able to view all the submitted receipts and accept or deny them based on the information shared by the driver. The admin has access to the entire application and can add and modify all other user's privileges.
